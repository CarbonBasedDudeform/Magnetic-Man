This allows the robot to solve puzzles involving metallic objects
that require the robot to move the objects towards them or further away
in order to move on to furthur parts of the level.

## Status

Currently only has a test level that shows the basic functionality
needed for the actual game. This includes the magnetic abilities, the 
magnetic power bar and the ability to "refuel" the magnetic power bar.
It also has what i would call basic gravity.
